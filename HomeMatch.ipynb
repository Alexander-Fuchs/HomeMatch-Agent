    "# HomeMatch Agent - Personalizing Real Estate with Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "In this project, I developed HomeMatch, an application that utilizes OpenAI's GPT models and a ChromaDB vector database to personalize real estate listings based on buyer preferences. Buyer inputs, such as preferred number of bedrooms, outdoor spaces, eco-friendly features, and neighborhood qualities, were transformed into vector embeddings using text-embedding-ada-002 for precise semantic matching with property listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each matched listing was further personalized using GPT-3.5 Turbo, enhancing the descriptions to align with buyer needs while maintaining factual accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "All generated listings were exported into a structured text file for review and future use."
